# 🌟 CraftNova

**CraftNova** is my personal graphic design showcase — a clean, modern, and responsive portfolio website where I share my design work, creative concepts, and visual explorations.

## 🎨 About the Project

CraftNova was built with simplicity, elegance, and user experience in mind. It features:

- A scrollable gallery of featured artwork
- Interactive popup view for each design collection
- Smooth navigation with a modern aesthetic
- A responsive layout that works beautifully across devices

This project reflects my journey as a graphic designer and serves as a creative archive of the work I’m most proud of.
